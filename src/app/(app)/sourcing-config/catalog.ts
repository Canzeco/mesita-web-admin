// Sourcing Config catalog — the human-facing taxonomy behind the policy table.
//
// Mesita onboards places sourced from Google Places (New). This catalog groups
// the ~150 Google primary types (Table A) into a handful of Mesita-relevant
// FAMILIES, and names the sourcing CHANNELS the policy is keyed by. The family
// keys and channel keys are the contract shared with the Edge Functions
// (admin-web-{get,update}-sourcing-config) — keep them in lock-step.
//
// The googleTypes arrays are the machine expansion of each family: the Google
// `primaryType` values a place must match to count as that family. They're the
// enforcement contract for the sourcing gate (admin discovery honours the floors
// today; the remaining add-paths read this as they're wired). Anything NOT in an
// enabled family is ineligible — that's how schools, hospitals, gas stations,
// hotels, shops and transit are kept out without an explicit blocklist.
